      "answer": "The given table compares different means of transportation in terms of the annual distance traveled by adults in two separate years, 1977 and 2007. Units are measured in miles.nnOverall, cars were by far the most popular method of transport during the entire 40-year period, witnessing the most dramatic rise. In contrast, bicycles and motorcycles were the least common modes of transportation. Regarding changes in commuting patterns, there was an upward trend in the use of cars, trains, and taxis, while the remaining methods of transport recorded a decline.nnIn 1977, cars occupied the position as the most prevalent vehicle, with 3,500 miles traveled, nearly quadruple the distance of the second and third most popular methods, buses and trains, which ranged from 800 to 900 miles. Meanwhile, the distance traveled on foot was 400 miles on average, twice as high as that of taxis. Bicycles were as common as motorbikes, with the average distance for each vehicle standing at 100 miles.nnBy 2007, the distance traveled by car had increased twofold to 7,100 miles, solidifying its position as the most preferred mode of transportation. Similar changes were seen in the figures for trains and taxis, with the former witnessing a slight growth to 1,000 miles and the latter recording a fourfold rise to 800 miles. In contrast, the other transport methods underwent a descending trend, with the most dramatic drop recorded in buses, falling by 300 miles to reach 500 miles in 2007. The distances traveled by walking, motorbikes, and bicycles dropped to 300, 90, and 80 miles, respectively."
