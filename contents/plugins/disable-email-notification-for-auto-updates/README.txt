**Disable Email Notifications for Auto-Updates:**
With the introduction of WordPress 5.5, the auto-update feature was enabled, and email notifications started being sent for every update made. By simply installing this plugin, you can stop receiving these annoying notifications for every auto-update made to plugins, themes, or even the WordPress core. Please note that this plugin will not affect the auto-update feature of WordPress if it is enabled.

**Block Specific Plugin Updates:**
In the "Block Plugin Updates" tab, the plugin will list all installed plugins on your website. If there are specific plugins you do not want to update, you can disable updates for those particular plugins.

**Block WordPress Core and Theme Updates:**
You also have the option to block updates for the WordPress core and themes. However, this is not recommended for security reasons.

**Remove Update Buttons from Admin Panel:**
If you do not want to see the "Updates" menu under the Dashboard, you can easily hide it from the admin panel menu.

**Default Settings:**
By default, only the email notification feature is turned on; other settings must be configured manually.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= New Features: Block updates for specific plugins =

You can now choose to block updates for specific plugins in the "Block Plugin Updates" tab. This tab will list all the installed plugins, and you can select the plugins for which you do not want updates or update notifications.

= New Features: Block WordPress core and theme updates =

We have added the feature to block WordPress core and theme updates. However, it is highly recommended to keep your site up-to-date for security reasons.

= Can Disable email Notification for auto-updates plugin be used with all the themes? =

Yes, you can use this plugin with any theme. We have tried with popular themes such as Enfold, Avada, Elementor page builders, Astra, Divi, etc and it works perfectly great.

= Why are some plugin updates not hidden? =

This plugin uses the default WordPress filter to block plugin updates. However, some premium plugins use their own APIs, which may bypass the default WordPress mechanisms. As a result, the code only blocks updates for plugins that follow the default WordPress update system. To mitigate this, we've added CSS and fallback JavaScript to hide the update notifications as much as possible.

= Will Disable email Notification for auto-updates plugin stops plugin, themes or WordPress updates? =

No, this plugin will only disable the email notifications that you receive after an auto-updates of plugins, themes, or WordPress core. If Auto Updates are enabled, your plugins, themes, and WordPress will update automatically.
